# CS126 Project Proposal: Stock Performance Comparison Platform ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
***
A miniature C++ platform that allows the user to compare different stocks, based on data visualization!
***
## Summary:
The C++ application will allow users to specify stock ticker symbols, which will then be used to retrieve performance data from the Alpha Vantage API. 

Visuals will be generated from the data, allowing users to make comparisons between the specified ticker symbols.

## Libraries: 

1) ofxJson will be used to retrieve data from the Alpha Vantage API
2) ofxGrafica will be used to generate graphs 
3) ofxDatGUi will be used to create the User Interface

***
## Checkpoints for next 3 weeks:

__Week 1:__ Make data retrieving aspect of the application

__Week 2:__ Work on generating visuals from the data.

__Week 3:__ Polishing the interface, while attempting to add a real time and prediction aspect

***
### Relevant Personal Background:

1) Previously worked with retrieving APIs

2) A basic understanding of Financial Markets
