# CS126 Project Proposal: Stock Performance Comparison Platform ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
A miniature C++ platform that allows the user to compare different stocks, ased on data visualization!

## Summary:
The C++ application will allow users to specify stock ticker symbols,  which will then be used to retrieve performance data from the Yahoo! Finance API. 

Visuals will be generated from the data, allowing users to make comparisons between the specified ticker symbols.

2) openGL will be used to generate 2D Visual Graphics from the data


## Checkpoints for next 3 weeks:

__Week 1:__ Make data retrieving aspect of the application

__Week 2:__ Work on generating visuals from the data.

__Week 3:__ Polishing the interface, while attempting to add a prediction method
